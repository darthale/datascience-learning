## Hyperparameters tuning

  - When you approach NN, there are many hyperparameters that need to be tuned. i.e:
  	- learning_rate
    - beta - exponentialy weighted averages
    - beta1, beta2, epsilon - Adam
    - number of layers
    - number of hidden units in each layer
    - learning rate decay 
    - mini-batch size

# Train/Dev/Test, Regularization, Initialization | Content

## Validation set

## Bias - Viarance in NN and a framework to follow

## Regularization Techniques

  - L1, L2: how to implement and why they reduce overfitting 
  - Dropout: how to implement and why they reduce overfitting
  - Data Augmentation

L2 and dropout basically sets values for W close to 0, reducing the number of features used by the model preveting more complicated models to arise


## Feature Normalization (std = 1, mean = 0)

  - How and why they help gradient descent: having every feature on the same scale allow the gradient descent to be faster since there's a limited space to move in

## Vanishing Gradients

  - Weights Initialization: initializing weights to certain values helps avoiding vanishing gradients
